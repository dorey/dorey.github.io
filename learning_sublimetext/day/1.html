  <h1>Learning a new text editor</h1>
  <p>
    Over the next two weeks, I will learn a new text editor: <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">sublimetext</a>. I know that it's not hard to learn a new text editor, but I think if I force myself to dig deeper and try out some of the many plug-ins, then I will not stop once I get proficient, and I will be better off.
  </p>
  <p>
    I will learn a new feature every day and post what I've learned. I'll pull from videos, tutorials, and anything else I find useful. If anyone has any features you recommend I try out, then please share your suggestions via <a href="http://twitter.com/sudorey">twitter</a> or email.

Notes:
I really like the syntax, which is why I picked it for day 1.

More notes coming tonight.
