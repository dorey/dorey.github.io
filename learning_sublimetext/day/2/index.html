    <div id="post">
      <p><em>Ctrl-P</em> gives a very quick and easy way to switch between files similar to textmate&#8217;s Cmd-T.</p>

<p>From the SublimeText homepage:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Use Goto Anything to quickly navigate between files, even in the largest projects. Ctrl+P shows Goto Anything, and typing then filters on file and directory names.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>But wait! There&#8217;s more.</em></p>

<p>After you type the file you want to go to, you can also jump directly to a symbol within that file.</p>

<p><em>*tries out goto anywhere*</em></p>

<p>It worked for me, except:</p>

<ol>
<li>I&#8217;m not sure how it defines symbols. <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0OtfjgnoLA#t=1m00s'>This guy</a> used it in his php project but I couldn&#8217;t jump to a css rule within &#8220;all.scss&#8221;, for example.</li>

<li>It doesn&#8217;t autocomplete the filenames, so if you want to jump to a symbol you need to type out the full name.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are solutions to all these problems, but I will have to find them out tomorrow.</p>

<p><em>Closing note:</em></p>

<p>A feature of TM&#8217;s Cmd-T that I used a lot was that the files showed up in order of when they were accessed. This made it very easy to quickly switch back and forth between 2 or 3 files. But this could be a poor solution to the problem. I know ST&#8217;s layouts are very useful, so maybe I&#8217;ll check those out tomorrow and not miss my old, choppy way of working back and forth on multiple files at once.</p>
