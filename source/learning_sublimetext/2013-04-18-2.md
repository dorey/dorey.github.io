title: "Day 2: Goto Anything"
---

*Ctrl-P* gives a very quick and easy way to switch between files similar to textmate's Cmd-T.

From the SublimeText homepage:

> Use Goto Anything to quickly navigate between files, even in the largest projects.
> Ctrl+P shows Goto Anything, and typing then filters on file and directory names.

## But wait! There's more.

After you type the file you want to go to, you can also jump directly to a symbol within that file by using the '@' symbol.

    Ctrl-P + `myfile.txt@mysymbol`
    # jumps to the symbol "mysymbol" within myfile.txt

Or you can jump directly to a word found within that file by using the '#' symbol.

    Ctrl-P + `myfile.txt#myword`
    # jumps to the first occurence of myword within myfile.txt

_\*tries out goto anywhere\*_

_\*it works! especially with the '#' symbol\*_

I'm still unclear on how it defines symbols. I'll probably have a better understanding of this when I've used ST on a full-scale project.

## Closing note:

ST's GotoAnything (Cmd-P) is much like TM's quick jump feature (Ctrl-T) except it can take more directions on where specifically you want to go withing the file.
