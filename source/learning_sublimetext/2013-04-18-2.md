title: "Day 2: Goto Anything"

*Ctrl-P* gives a very quick and easy way to switch between files similar to textmate's Cmd-T.

From the SublimeText homepage:

> Use Goto Anything to quickly navigate between files, even in the largest projects.
> Ctrl+P shows Goto Anything, and typing then filters on file and directory names.

## But wait! There's more.

After you have specified the file name, you can jump directly to something within the file:

* *myfile.txt@mysymbol* will jump to the symbol "mysymbol"
* *myfile.txt#myword* will jump to the first occurence of "myword" within the file
* *myfile.txt:99* will jump directly to line 99

_\*tries out goto anywhere\*_

_\*it works! especially with the '#' symbol\*_

I'm still unclear on how it defines symbols. I'll probably have a better understanding of this when I've used ST on a full-scale project.

## Closing note:

ST's GotoAnything (Cmd-P) is much like TM's quick jump feature (Ctrl-T) except it can take more directions on where specifically you want to go withing the file.
