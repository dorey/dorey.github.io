title: "Day 2: Goto Anything"
---

*Ctrl-P* gives a very quick and easy way to switch between files similar to textmate's Cmd-T.

From the SublimeText homepage:

> Use Goto Anything to quickly navigate between files, even in the largest projects.
> Ctrl+P shows Goto Anything, and typing then filters on file and directory names.

*But wait! There's more.*

After you type the file you want to go to, you can also jump directly to a symbol within that file.

_\*tries out goto anywhere\*_

It worked for me, except:

1. I'm not sure how it defines symbols. [This guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0OtfjgnoLA#t=1m00s) used it in his php project but I couldn't jump to a css rule within "all.scss", for example.
2. It doesn't autocomplete the filenames, so if you want to jump to a symbol you need to type out the full name.

There are solutions to all these problems, but I will have to find them out tomorrow.

_Closing note:_

A feature of TM's Cmd-T that I used a lot was that the files showed up in order of when they were accessed. This made it very easy to quickly  switch back and forth between 2 or 3 files. But this could be a poor solution to the problem. I know ST's layouts are very useful, so maybe I'll check those out tomorrow and not miss my old, choppy way of working back and forth on multiple files at once.
