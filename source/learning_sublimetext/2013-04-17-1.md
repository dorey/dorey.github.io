title: "Day 1: Zen Coding"
---

"Zen coding" is a quick way to build HTML. It allows you to describe a one-line path (similar to an XPath) and expand it out into fully indented, multi-line HTML.

If I want to create a `div` with a `ol` list with five items in it, I would start by describing the list:

    div>ol>li*5>a

 I could also add class names or tag IDs:

    div#wrap>ol.items>li*3>a

 And this would get expanded out to:

     <div id="wrap">
     	<ol class="items">
     		<li><a href=""></a></li>
     		<li><a href=""></a></li>
     		<li><a href=""></a></li>
     	</ol>
     </div>

This feature is available as an add-on for SublimeText, and can be downloaded [here](http://code.google.com/p/zen-coding/). It's not a game-changer, but having this in the tool belt will help shave off a good deal of time from one of the more monotonous day-to-day tasks: editing XML.
