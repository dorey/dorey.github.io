## Installation needed

First, you need to make sure you have [Sublime Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control) installed. (I followed the directions to paste a command into the sublimetext console.)

Then, you can easily install additional plug ins:

Running `Shift-Ctrl-P + 'install'` will bring up a dialog box. Type the name of the plug-in and push "enter". You should then be able to use the plug-in.
