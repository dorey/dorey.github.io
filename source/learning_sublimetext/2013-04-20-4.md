title: "Day 4: Quick word selection and file traversal"
---

*Ctrl-D* will select the current word. Subsequent "Ctrl-D" will *add selection of* the next instance of that word in the file.

_Note_: This `add-next-selection` command is reversed by the `undo-latest-added-selection` command: `Ctrl-U`

_I originally confused this with the "find-next" functionality provided by F3._
