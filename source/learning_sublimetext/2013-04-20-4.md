title: "Day 4: Quick word selection and file traversal"
---

*Ctrl-D* will select the current word. Subsequent "Ctrl-D" will select the next instance of that word in the file.

_I use this trick often during refactoring to check how many occurrences of a given word are in a file and quickly see where it is. If there is a better way to do this that doesn't involve jumping to a different part of the file then I would like to learn it._
