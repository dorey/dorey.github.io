title: "Day 6: Multiple cursors"
---

This is an oft-touted mega feature of sublime text that I have to admit that I do not fully understand at this moment.

I have seen videos of people praising it as a huge timesaver over the traditional "Find and replace" method.

I'm writing it up for day 6 because it is pretty neat in those cases where you need to use it.

## Selecting Text

First, you have the ability to select incongruous text. You can do this by either:

* With a single block of text selected, you can `Ctrl-Click` on the words you want to select.
* With a single word or set of words selected, you can `Ctrl-D` (quick-add-next) until you have what you want selected.
* With a single word or set of words selected, you can `Alt-F3` to quick-select-all matches in the document.

## Bulk changing the selections

Once you have incongruous selections, you'll notice an army of little text cursors waiting to do your bidding. Anything you type or do will be done for each cursor.

## Getting out of multiple selections

`Escape` will cancel the multiple selections and drop you off at the top one.
