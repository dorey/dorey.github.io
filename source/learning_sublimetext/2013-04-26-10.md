title: "Git integration"

## Installation

`Ctrl-Shift-P + install` and search for "Git"

## Usage

After installation, you can use it by accessing the "Command Palette" `Ctrl-Shift-P + git` which will provide a list of the commands which you can use.

## Personal note

I'm not really happy with the git integration that I've seen so far. I was imagining a tool that makes it easy to stage and commit specific lines, similar to what you can get with GitK.

I will try to use it more and update this note if I find any tricks that made it easier for me.
