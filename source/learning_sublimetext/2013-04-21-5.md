title: "Day 6: Quick searching entire project"
---

*Ctrl-F* and *Ctrl-Shift-F* will open up an input box to quick box to search the entire project.

Unlike TM, which opens up a separate "results" box, ST opens up a new text buffer to display the results. (I think this resembles how emacs would display the results.)

Conveniently, the paths that show up in the buffer are double-clickable and take you directly to the file.

_Personal note: I use this feature every day in TM. Very glad to see it exists in ST as well._
