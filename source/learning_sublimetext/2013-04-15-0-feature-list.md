title: "Feature List&mdash; Textmate vs. SublimeText"
---

This is just a list of noted features and shortcuts that I would like to learn how to do in SublimeText (many of which are possible in TextMate.)

| Feature description                                  | Sublime | TextMate   |
|:-----------------------------------------------------|:-------:|:----------:|
| A "Project drawer" displaying the directory tree     | ?       | ?          |
| Fast switching between files in the project          | ?       | Cmd-T      |
| Quick project-wide grepping for text                 | ?       | Cmd-Shft-F |
| Best-matched autocompletion                          | Tab     | Escape     |
